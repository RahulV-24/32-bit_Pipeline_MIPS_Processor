# 32-bit_Pipeline_MIPS_Processor
- Developed and implemented a 5-stage pipeline architecture encompassing Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Write Back stages, optimizing processor performance.
- Employed advanced pipelining and forwarding techniques using Verilog HDL to reduce critical path delay, resulting in an efficiently performing processor.
